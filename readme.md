I knew I was not going to have time this week. My job is insanely demanding.
So I started work on it early. Hopefully that is in the spirit of the jam ... I wont be able to work on it during the real jam time...
hopefully one day early is not horrible?

The theme of the game is just avoid the damn boxes.

I shortened just about anyway I could. I took all the standard shortcuts available with pico8.
aka the if shortcut and also the +=,-= shortcut where I could
I also picked function names I used and aliased them to shorter function names. Usually single letters.

Assuming I counted correctly I am at 556 (I am relying on VScode...)

I added the glitch effect at the very end. I referenced this memory layout.

The numbers are very specific to not go past the video memory.
